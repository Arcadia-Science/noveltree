1) ASTEROID : asteroid\_1.0  
    - previously 'austinhpatton123/asteroid:1.0.0'  
    - this is one of the AGPL-3 licenses. 
2) COGEQC : cogeqc\_r-4.2.2  
    - previously 'austinhpatton123/cogeqc-1.2.0_r-4.2.2'
    - probably should add the cogeqc version to the tag
3) ORTHOFINDER (prep, mcl, phylohogs) : orthofinder\_2.5.4  
    - orthofinder prep previously used 'quay.io/biocontainers/orthofinder:2.5.4--hdfd78af\_0'  
    - other orthofinder moduled previously used 'austinhpatton123/orthofinder-2.5.4\_r-4.2.2'  
    - just catching this now - will be good to make consistent  
4) SELECT\_INFLATION : select\_i\_r-4.2.2

7) FILTER_ORTHOGROUPS : r-4.2.2  
    - previously 'austinhpatton123/cogeqc-1.2.0\_r-4.2.2'

8) ANNOTATE\_UNIPROT : uniprotws\_r-4.2.2  
    - previously 'austinhpatton123/r-4.2.2\_uniprot.ws:2.38.0'
